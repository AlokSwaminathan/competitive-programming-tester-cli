# cp-tester
CLI Tool for easy testing of competitive programming problems
Makes it easy to run tests using a terminal command instead of having to reupload to a website every time

Supports C, C++, Java, and Python, however, C, Java, and Python use the versions that come installed on your PC (this could change in the future if people want)
